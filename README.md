# From Outliers to Topics in Language Models: Anticipating Trends in News Corpora

This repository contains the visualizations and code accompanying our paper submission to [ICNLSP 2025](https://www.icnlsp.org/2025welcome/). 

## Repository Structure

### `CODE`
This section contains Python scripts for the full experimental setup, organized by section:
- **4.2 & 5.2 Embeddings Cumulative Clustering**:
  - Silhouette score analysis by corpus (Tables 2 and 5).
  - Timeframe scatter plots for TP (Figure 1) and GHG (Figure 4).
- **4.3 & 5.3 Outlier Behavior Analysis**:
  - Hypothesis validation bar plots per model (Figures 2 and 5).
  - Proportion of outliers converting to clusters or remaining as outliers per Model (Tables 3 and 6).
  - Longitudinal analysis of outlier behavior and trend shifts.
- **4.4 & 5.4 Interpretation**:
  - TF-IDF score Delta between outliers classes.
  - Subjectivity and neutrality Spearman correlation analysis.
  - Stylometric analysis box plots comparing outlier classes.
  - Statistical significance results (Figures 3 and 6).

### `PLOTS`
Contains visual representations availiable on the paper:
- Timeframe scatter plots for TP and GHG datasets.
- Hypothesis validation bar plots by model.
- Stylometric analysis plots comparing outlier classes, including statistical significance results.
